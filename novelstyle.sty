\usepackage[english]{babel}

% Let punctuation protude slightly over margin boundary:
\usepackage[protrusion=true,final,babel=true]{microtype}
% No double-spacing after periods:
\frenchspacing

% Don't let LaTeX try to deal with orphans/widows for you (can be done better by hand, and orphans/widows often look fine if they're not preceded/followed by a section break):
\clubpenalty=0
\widowpenalty=0

% Don't let LaTeX insert vertical space between paragraphs when the page might be a line or so short:
\raggedbottom
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%% PAGE SET-UP %%%%%%%%%%%
% To be printed on A5 paper (actually A4 paper, but that's dealt with later, during the print imposition)
\setstocksize{210mm}{148.5mm}
% The actual page size, here with a 4:3 ratio
\settrimmedsize{193mm}{145mm}{*}
% Trim 17 mm from the top and 3.5 mm from the fore-edge after printing:
\settrims{17mm}{3.5mm}

% Uncomment this to preview the book wihtout the trims to see what the final results will look like:
% \setstocksize{193mm}{145mm}
% \settrimmedsize{193mm}{145mm}{*}
% \settrims{0mm}{0mm}

% Left/right margins:
\setlrmarginsandblock{15mm}{25mm}{*}

\setulmarginsandblock{15mm}{30mm}{*}

\makeevenhead{numeredpage}{}{}{}
\makeoddhead{numeredpage}{}{}{}
\makeevenfoot{numeredpage}{\thepage}{}{}

% The style used by chapter opening pages. In this case, the same as the regular style:

% Font sizes! The most important one is \normalsize. The first value is the font size, the second the leading.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SECTION TYPES %%%%%%%%%
% I like to define what section transitions look like, this one is just a vertical skip, but you can also add ornaments etc.
\newcommand{\sectionsep}{\vspace{2\baselineskip}}

% This one is a fun little ornaments:

\sbox{\myrule}{\tikz
	{\path [draw, line width=0.2mm] (-0.06,0) to (0,0.06) to (0.06,0) to (0,-0.06) to cycle;

		\path [draw, line width=0.2mm] (0.06,0) to (0.8,0);}

	\begin{center}
		\vspace*{0.8mm}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%% LINE LENGTH FIXES %%%%%
% Prefer increasing the inter-word spacing over creating overlong lines
\setlength{\emergencystretch}{.5em}

% Only use this if absolutely necessary! 
% Changes the tracking of whatever line/paragraph it contains
% The second arg is the change: negative to squeeze the text, positive to stretch it. Stay as close to 0 as possible!
\newcommand{\squeeze}[2]{{\addfontfeature{LetterSpace=#2}#1}}

% Minimum extra line length before the compiler starts complaining
\hfuzz=2.7pt
% Ways to fix line breaks:
% - \\
% - \allowbreak{}
% - \- (inserts hyphen if LaTeX breaks the line)
% - \mbox{ ... } (no break!)
% - ~ (non-breaking space)

% Use these when custom hyphenation doesn't do the trick.
% They stretch the whitespace in otherwise too short lines
% (include up to the word before the one that's overlong).
% This first one is just the utility one called by the others:
\newcommand{\spreadline}[4]{%
	\makebox[\dimexpr#2-#3+#4][s]{#1}%
}
\newcommand{\spreadlineparnobr}[1]{%
	\spreadline{#1}{\textwidth}{\parindent}{0pt}%
}
% Spreads an indented line:
\newcommand{\spreadlinepar}[1]{%
	\spreadlineparnobr{#1}\\%
}
\newcommand{\spreadlineparnobrhyph}[1]{%
	\spreadline{#1}{\textwidth}{\parindent}{1pt}%
}
% Spreads an indented line ending with a hyphen:
\newcommand{\spreadlineparhyph}[1]{%
	\spreadlineparnobrhyph{#1}\\%
}
\newcommand{\spreadlinemidnobr}[1]{%
	\spreadline{#1}{\textwidth}{0pt}{0pt}%
}
% Spreads a line in the middle of a paragraph:
\newcommand{\spreadlinemid}[1]{%
	\spreadlinemidnobr{#1}\\%
}
\newcommand{\spreadlinemidnobrhyph}[1]{%
	\spreadline{#1}{\textwidth}{0pt}{1pt}%
}
% Spreads a line in the middle of a paragraph ending with a hyphen:
\newcommand{\spreadlinemidhyph}[1]{%
	\spreadlinemidnobrhyph{#1}\\%
